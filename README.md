# AccessAber: iPhone app to help people navigate through Aberystwyth University's Penglais campus

This was my major university project, to see if a mobile app can help people of reduced
mobility around the hilly and complicated Penglais campus.

The app uses augmented OpenStreetMap data to help people get to places on campus,
by using routing algorithms and indoor mapping.

It got to prototype stage but did not have the time to reach a finished product.
I hope to revisit this in the future. In the mean time, this shows how I used OSM data
in an Objective-C iOS app.
